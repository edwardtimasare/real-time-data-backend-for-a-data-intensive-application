# real-time-data-backend-for-a-data-intensive-application
This document outlines developing and deploying a real-time data processing system for user analytics and leveraging the randomuser.me API for data generation for E-commerce such as Product names, prices, order IDs, timestamps, and purchase locations to mimic online sales.
I Will be using Apache Kafka for data streaming and Apache Spark for processing. The system is been built to be scalable, reliable, and capable of handling large volumes of user data. The deployment is containerised using Docker, ensuring easy management and replication of the system. The processed data is stored in Cassandra, providing efficient retrieval for further analysis.
Key Components of the User Analytics Project:
1.	Data Source: Uses the randomuser.me API to generate synthetic user data for the pipeline.
2.	Event Simulation: Simulates events related to user activities, generating a continuous stream of data.
3.	Metrics: Focuses on user demographics, activity patterns, and engagement metrics.

Tools & Technologies
The following tools and technologies are used to develop and deploy the system:
•	randomuser.me API: Provides a data source with synthetic user data for testing the pipeline.
•	Apache Airflow: Orchestrates the pipeline, handling data extraction from the API and storing it in PostgreSQL.
•	PostgreSQL: Acts as the initial storage for raw data fetched from the API.
•	Apache Kafka and Zookeeper: Manages data streaming from PostgreSQL to Apache Spark for processing.
•	Control Center and Schema Registry: Monitors Kafka streams and manages schemas to ensure consistency in data formats.
•	Apache Spark: Processes streaming data in real-time, running transformations and calculations on user activity data.
•	Cassandra: Stores processed data for fast retrieval and efficient querying.
•	Docker: Containerizes each component, allowing for easy deployment and scalability.
Data Ingestion
Apache Airflow is responsible for orchestrating the pipeline, triggering requests to the randomuser.me API to fetch random user data. Once retrieved, this data is stored in PostgreSQL, acting as a temporary storage location before further processing.
Data Streaming and Processing
•	Apache Kafka: Streams data from PostgreSQL to Apache Spark, with Zookeeper managing Kafka's distributed environment. Control Center and Schema Registry are used to monitor data flow and manage schemas, ensuring data integrity.
•	Apache Spark: Receives data streams from Kafka, performing real-time processing. Transformations include data cleaning, aggregation, and calculation of metrics like user demographics and engagement.
Data Storage and Management
•	Cassandra: Acts as the long-term storage for processed data. With its distributed and scalable architecture, Cassandra is optimized for handling large-scale datasets, providing efficient retrieval and supporting further analytics. 
Orchestration and Monitoring
Apache Airflow manages the execution of each task, ensuring that data is fetched, processed, and stored in sequence. This orchestration allows for easy pipeline monitoring and handling of task dependencies. Control Center and Schema Registry enable Kafka stream monitoring, ensuring that data is processed in real-time without loss of integrity.
Containerization
Docker is used to containerize each component, enabling a consistent and reproducible environment across development and production stages. This containerization allows the entire pipeline to be easily scaled and deployed.
